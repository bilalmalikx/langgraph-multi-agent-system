       " 'language_feedback': \"The essay presents clear ideas about the evolution and impact of technology on modern society, which is a relevant and engaging topic. However, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrases which detract from the overall quality of the writing. For example, the incorrect verb forms ('have evolved' instead of 'has evolved', 'was transforming' instead of 'is transforming', etc.) and some misspellings ('developement', 'Inteligence', 'peoples', etc.) indicate a lack of attention to grammatical accuracy. Additionally, the structure could be improved for clarity; some sentences are overly long or convoluted. The essay would benefit from a more organized flow of ideas and smoother transitions between concepts. Overall, while the content is compelling, the language quality hampers its effectiveness.\",\n",
       " 'analysis_feedback': \"The essay presents an interesting thesis regarding the dual nature of technology's impact on society. It begins by tracing the evolution of technology and its influence on various domains, showing a broad grasp of historical context and current implications. However, while the points raised are valid, the depth of analysis is somewhat superficial. Key concepts like the Industrial Revolution and Digital Age are mentioned but not explored in detail. The argument regarding the dual impact of technology on human relationships lacks specific examples or supporting evidence, which would strengthen the analysis. Moreover, the essay has grammatical errors and issues with sentence structure that hinder its overall clarity and professionalism. Phrases like 'the very meaning of developement' are vague and need refinement. Additionally, while ethical and environmental concerns are introduced, there is little discussion on what these challenges specifically entail or how they can be mitigated. A more comprehensive exploration of these themes alongside sharper writing could significantly enhance the quality of the essay. \\n\\nIn summary, the essay shows promise with its central argument but needs greater depth, coherence, and proper proofreading to communicate its points effectively. More concrete examples and a clearer structure would also enrich the analysis.\",\n",
       " 'clarity_feedback': 'The essay exhibits a clear thought process concerning the evolution of technology and its impacts on society. However, there are several areas where clarity could be improved. For example, the transition between ideas sometimes feels abrupt, which may confuse readers. The argument would benefit from a more structured approach, grouping related concepts together and providing clearer connections between points. Additionally, grammatical errors (like \"have evolved\" should be \"has evolved\", and the use of singular and plural) distract from the overall message. The discussion of technology\\'s dual nature is insightful, but further elaboration on specific examples could enhance understanding. Overall, while the ideas are relevant and thought-provoking, the clarity is hindered by language and structural issues.',\n",
